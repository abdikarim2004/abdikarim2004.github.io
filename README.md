# MOSQUE MEDINA WEBSITE PROJECT

This repository contains the code for a website developed during our second year of vocational school for our local mosque, MOSQUE MEDINA.

## About the Project

This was our first ever web development project. The goal was to create an online presence for the mosque, providing information about the mosque itself, prayer times, and contact details. While the project was completed and somewhat functional, it was done with limited knowledge and experience. As such, it may not represent best practices or optimal performance.

## Key Features

- Basic information about the mosque
- Prayer times
- Location
- Contact details

## Disclaimer

This project was our initial foray into web development and, as such, may contain several inefficiencies and poor design choices. It does not reflect my current skill level after three additional years of programming experience and education.

## Future Improvements

Given the chance to redo this project, I would:

- Redesign the user interface for better usability and aesthetics
- Build a functional backend that would enhance the websites usability
- Ensure the website is fully responsive and accessible
- Apply modern development frameworks and tools
