# MOSQUE MEDINA WEBSITE PROJECT

This repository contains the code for a website developed during our second year of vocational school for our local mosque, MOSQUE MEDINA.

## About the Project

This was our first ever web development project. The goal was to create an online presence for the mosque, providing information about services, events, and contact details. While the project was completed and functional, it was done with limited knowledge and experience. As such, it may not represent best practices or optimal performance.

## Key Features

- Basic information about the mosque
- Event announcements
- Contact details

## Disclaimer

This project was our initial foray into web development and, as such, may contain several inefficiencies and poor design choices. It does not reflect my current skill level after two additional years of programming experience and education.

## Current Skills and Expertise

Since completing this project, I have significantly improved my programming skills, especially in the following areas:

- Frontend development using modern frameworks and libraries
- Backend development and database management
- Responsive design and user experience enhancements
- Adhering to best practices in coding and project management

## Future Improvements

Given the chance to redo this project, I would:

- Redesign the user interface for better usability and aesthetics
- Implement a more efficient and secure backend
- Ensure the website is fully responsive and accessible
- Apply modern development frameworks and tools
